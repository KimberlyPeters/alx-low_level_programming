## C - More pointers, arrays and strings


In this project, I continued to practice using pointers, arrays and strings in C.


### Helper File 🙌

* _putchar.c: C function that writes a character to ```stdout```.

### Header File 📁

* main.h: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
