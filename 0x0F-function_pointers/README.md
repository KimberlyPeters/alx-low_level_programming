## C - Function pointers

In this project, I learned about function pointers in C - what they hold, where they point in virtual memory, and how to use them.

### Helper File 🙌
* [_putchar.c]: C function that writes a character to ```stdout```.

### Header Files 📁

* [function_pointers.h]: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written for programs 0-2 of the project.
