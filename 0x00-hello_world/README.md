* 4-puts.c is a C program that prints exactly ```"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle```, followed by a new line, using the function ```puts```.
---------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------
* 6-size.c is a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on
--------------------------------------------
* 100-intel is a script that generates the assembly code in Intel syntax of a C file saved in the variable $CFILE; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a ```.s``` extension
--------------------------------------------------
