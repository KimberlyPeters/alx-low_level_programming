## C - More malloc, free

In this project, I learned about using ```exit```, ```calloc```, and ```realloc``` in C.

### Helper File 🙌
* _putchar.c: C function that writes a character to ```stdout```.

### Header File 📁
* main.h: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
