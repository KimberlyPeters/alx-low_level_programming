### In this project, I learned about using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C. Additionally, I practiced declaring and defining variables of type ```char```, ```int```, and ```unsigned int```, using ```if``` and ```if...else``` statements, and implementing ```while``` loops.
--------------------------------
* 0-positive_or_negative.c is a C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative, followed by a new line
------------------------------------
* 1-last_digit.c is a C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number, followed by a new line
-----------------------------------------------------
* 2-print_alphabet.c is a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the ```putchar``` function exactly twice
-----------------------
* 3-print_alphabets.c is a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the ```putchar``` function exactly three times
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 4-print_alphabt.c is a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except for the letters ```q``` and ```e```, followed by a new line, using only the ```putchar``` function exactly twice
---------------------------------------
* 5-print_numbers.c is a C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line
-------------------------------
* 6-print_numberz.c is a C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the ```putchar``` function exactly twice without any variables of type ```char```
-----------------------------------------
* 7-print_tebahpla.c is a C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the ```putchar``` function exactly twice
-------------------------------------
* 8-print_base16.c is a C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the ```putchar``` function exactly three times
----------------------------------------
* 9-print_comb.c is a C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the ```putchar``` function exactly four times without any variables of type ```char```
	* Numbers are printed in ascending order
	* Numbers are separated by ```,```, followed by a space
------------------------------------
* 100-print_comb3.c is a C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits using only the ```putchar``` function exactly five times without any variables of type ```char```
	* ```01``` and ```10``` are considered the same combination of the two digits ```0``` and ```1```
	* Numbers are printed in ascending order
	* Numbers are separated by ```,```, followed by a space
---------------------------------------
* 101-print_comb4.c is a C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits using only the ```putchar``` function exactly six times without any variables of type ```char```
	* ```012```, ```120```, ```102```, ```021```, ```201``` and ```210``` are considered the same combination of the three digits ```0```, ```1``` and ```2```
	* Numbers are printed in ascending order
	* Numbers are separated by ```,```, followed by a space
------------------------------------------
* 102-print_comb5.c is a C program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers using only the ```putchar``` function exactly eight times without any variables of type ```char```
	* Numbers range from ```0``` to ```99```
	* Numbers are printed with two digits [ie. ```1``` is printed as ```01```]
	* ```00 01``` and ```01 00``` are considered the same as the combination of of the numbers ```0``` and ```1```
	* Numbers are printed in ascending order
	* Numbers are separated by ```,```, followed by a space
