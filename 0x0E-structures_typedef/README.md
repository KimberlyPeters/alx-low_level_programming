## C - Structures, typedef

In this project, I learned about using structures and typedef in C.

### Header File üìÅ

* [dog.h](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0E-structures_typedef/dog.h): Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions written in the project.


| ```Type/File```  | ```Defintion/Prototype``` |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ```struct dog```  | * ```char *name```   |
		    | * ```float age```	   |
		    | * ```char *owner```  |
