## Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

* All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases


### This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track in the ALX Software Engineering Program. In these projects I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C programming language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x03. C - Debugging](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging)
* [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
* [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/KimberlyPeters/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings)
